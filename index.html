          <h2>The Painting of friendship</h2>
          <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
              In this world of deceit, some bonds are formed<br>
              A treasure called friendship is truly adorned<br>
              With strokes of trust and different colours of laughter's embrace<br>
              A painting of friendship, let me now trace<br>
              <br>
              Like the weekends beats, friendship rings<br>
              A melody of souls that joyously sings<br>
              Through phases of life, together we stride<br>
              In Times of triumph or when tears we hide<br>
              <br>
              A friend is a shelter in the pouring rain<br>
              A beacon of light in the darkest terrain<br>
              Growing together, like crops on a farm<br>
              Together, we find solace and calm<br>
              <br>
              With understanding eyes they see our plight<br>
              After a few roasts and laughs, comes the guiding light<br>
              Through trials and tests, they never depart<br>
              Just their presence soothes the heart<br>
              <br>
              Through many gmeets, memories were made<br>
              In playful banters and fights unswayed<br>
              They celebrate our victories, without envy or strife<br>
              In the drawing of friendship the colors are rife<br>
              <br>
              They'll lift you up when spirits are low<br>
              Chess valorant and backchod discussions to forget your woe<br>
              They encourage and inspire to always grow<br>
              They'll stand as a pillar, unwavering and strong<br>
              As companions who'll stand by me lifelong<br>
              Support me irrespective I'm right or wrong<br>
              Because of friendship we find strength anew<br>
              Union of souls both old and true<br>
              For in journey of life we are blessed<br>
              With friends by our side, comfortably/uncomfortably caressed<br>
              <br>
              So let us cherish, these bonds we hold <br>
              In this world so cold, they're more valuable than gold<br>
              In future together we create chaos abound <br>
              The painting of friendship, this poem expounds<br>
              That this is a treasure forever renowned<br>
              <br>

          <h2>Look me in the eye</h2>
          <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
              When you don't look me in the eye <br>
              Could you tell me the reason why <br>
              Is it that you don't know what to say<br> 
              Or you just don't like me anyway <br>
              <br>
              The train , the street<br>
              The strangers that greet<br>
              Are better than the friends who looked at their feet<br> 
              And later when we actually meet <br>
              They will always deny <br>
              That they didn't see me when they didn't look me in the eye<br>
              <br>
              Friends or foe, real or fake,<br>
              The ones that behave differently for an advantage's sake<br>
              Some want to impress<br>
              While others seek to oppress<br>
              But amidst the charades and games they play<br>
              I long for honesty, genuine display<br>
              <br>
              Yet, I find solace in the authenticity rare<br>
              In those who meet my gaze without a care<br>
              For they reveal a truth beyond disguise<br>
              A connection forged, where trust can rise<br>
              <br>
              So, let them avert their eyes and pretend<br>
              While I seek the companions who comprehend<br>
              That true friendship is not about pretense<br>
              But rather about trust, love, and immense<br>
              <br>
              In the end, those who cannot meet my stare<br>
              Are merely shadows, fleeting and unaware<br>
              For the ones who truly see, deep and wide<br>
              Are the ones who'll forever stand by my side<br>
              <br>
              So, if you don't look me in the eye<br>
              Know that it's your loss, not mine, oh why?<br>
              For I'll continue to seek those who see<br>
              The beauty within, the real you and me<br>

          <h2>My First Trek</h2>
          <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
              It was a very dark night <br>
              I was nervous with fright<br>
              And excitement was not in check<br>
              I was going for my first trek<br>
              <br>
              It was another thing I didn't want to try<br>
              As I am generally too afraid even to cry<br>
              My cousin and my friend convinced me to come<br>
              It was better than sitting at home like a bag of scum<br>
              <br>
              There were 20 people 4 guides<br> 
              We began the journey with small strides<br> 
              A few moments later we stopped for introduction somewhere<br>
              A few moments later I realized I was the youngest person there <br>
              <br>
              We all walked uphill with torches in our hands<br> 
              We hopped our  way through the muddy strands<br>
              Few hours later  I was completely tired<br>
              But A few snacks and the first sight of the peak got me all fired<br>
              It felt very good with friends around <br>
              And the icing on the cake was nature all around<br>
              It was still pretty dark<br>
              But I saw something shining on the trees<br>
              Fireflies they were, glowing with spark<br>
              The experience was even more mesmerizing, because of the gentle breeze<br>
              <br>
              As we moved forward, there was dryness in my throat<br>
              Name of the place was Kalavantin fort<br>
              Drinking some water was so much better<br>
              As every sip made our bags so much lighter<br>
              <br>
              As time passed the peak came closer<br>
              The real difficult part had begun<br>
              I was very scared but i didn't want to be a choker<br> 
              But I couldn't think for long as I needed to reach the top before coming up of the sun<br>
              <br>
              It was a very steep rocky climb<br>
              To top it off there was nothing on either side<br>
              The difference were the people around<br>
              Who encouraged and helped me to climb<br>
              Safe and sound<br>

              The guides stood on the edge<br>
              Held my hand on every step<br>
              Not afraid of getting hurt by a sharp hedge<br>
              Helping the unexperienced like Johny depp<br>
              <br>
              Finally on the top, there was straight patch<br>
              We had to climb vertically up using a rope tied on the top<br>
              Can't say the mission was accomplished without a scratch<br>
              After having breakfast, I realised this was not the stop<br>
              <br>
              As the sun began to rise, casting its golden glow<br>
              We beheld a breathtaking sight from the peak's plateau<br>
              The world unfolded before our eyes, vast and grand<br>
              Mountains, valleys, and a panoramic view of the land<br>
              <br>
              With a sense of triumph, we embraced the moment<br>
              Our fears conquered, our limits stretched and bent<br>
              The first trek had transformed into a journey of growth<br>
              Pushing boundaries, discovering strength we didn't know<br>
              <br>
              As we made our descent, with memories in our hearts<br>
              A newfound confidence in us, like a work of art<br>
              The dark night had paved the way for a beautiful day<br>
              And the lessons learned would forever stay<br>
              <br>
              For even in the darkest of nights, there's a spark<br>
              Waiting to ignite, guiding us through the dark<br>
              And so, with gratitude and a newfound zest<br>
              We left the mountain, knowing we had truly been blessed<br>

              It was the break of dawn <br>
              My mother came in my room and turned the lights on<br>
              She said get up son,you need to go  <br>
              You're already late ,don't be slow<br>
              <br>
              It was the begining of a new journey <br>
              From school to college, a path of new discovery <br>
              My father said these are the most important years of your life <br>
              More difficult than cutting a log of wood with a pocketknife<br>
              <br>
              You'll have to study a lot said my mother<br>
              You won't get time to play said my brother<br>
              My older friends said that you will suffer<br>
              All these thoughts made me stutter<br>
              <br>
              Going to PACE ,on my way<br>
              A classmate told me you have to study 18 hours a day<br>
              10 lakh students dreamt with their mind and soul<br>
              Getting into IIT was their main life goal<br>
              <br>
              The total seats were ten thousand<br>
              Better was the return ratio of equity based mutual fund<br>
              Getting less marks made me feel sad<br>
              The sine thetas and cos thetas made me go mad<br>
              <br>
              All those bonds,all those atoms<br>
              All those pulleys,all those free body diagrams<br>
              All these things made my head spin<br>
              I always felt I was in a battle I could never win<br>
              <br>
              My friends ,my teachers and my family of course <br>
              Their motivation my only energy source<br>
              That was what kept me going <br>
              There should've been gratefulness which I wasn't showing<br>
              <br>
              Not being able to enjoy, made me grumpy<br>
              Not getting sound sleep,made me sloppy<br>
              These were things that gave me headaches<br>
              These were the reasons i made mistakes<br>
              <br>
              Now I am doing engineering , obviously not from IIT <br>
              Said that just to kill your anxiety<br>
              Now when go back through those memories <br>
              The stories just make me freeze<br>
              <br>
              Never had I thought ,solving a sum would make me joyful<br>
              And now I realise my teachers were so helpful <br>
              Talking to friends for hours,to clear doubts of course<br>
              Doing integrations and calculating the magnitude of force<br>
              <br>
              These days have taught a lot to me<br>
              That life will never be easy <br>
              Difficult was my life is something even I see<br>
              But these were the days worth the sweat These are the days I won't forget <br>
              And these are the days I won't regret.<br>

          <h2>A Farmer's Story</h2>
          <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
              One fine day <br>
              I was walking along the bay <br>
              Near a temple on the road I saw a man pray <br>
              His face sunk in dismay <br>
              <br>
              I asked him "hello sir , what is your pain?" <br>
              He said " since a long time my village has seen no rain"<br>
              "All the sown seeds will go in vain <br>
              And all the hard work down the drain"<br>
              <br>
              Assuring him I said" it will rain there soon"<br>
              I started to move as it was a hot noon<br>
              Then I heard him hum a sad tune <br>
              Something about khaleri and the monsoon<br>
              <br>
              From khaleri I came to borrow another loan <br>
              Need to talk to my family ,can I borrow your phone <br>
              To tell them that I was denied <br>
              From the side of his eye he cried <br>
              <br>
              I left after he was done <br>
              He cried a lot, not at all fun<br>
              Next Day, along the bay <br>
              Near the temple a body lay<br>
              <br>
              Killed he was because of nature's wrrath <br>
              dense white froth emerged from his mouth<br>
              On the side of his coat<br>
              There was a small note <br>
              <br>
              It said please send this money to my family <br>
              So they can live the next few days happily <br>
              Inside there were 15000 rupees <br>
              That wasn't even 1/10 th of my fees<br>
              <br>
              With the money there was a receipt of the loan<br>
              The loan was so small <br>
              From my eye it made a tear fall<br>
              More was the cost of my phone <br>
              <br>
              Told this and asked help from my father<br>
              And gathered all I could gather <br>
              Requested help from a local farmer's help fund <br>
              And sent to khaleri a sum of one lakh and fifty thousand. <br>

          <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
              My life was at an all time low<br>
              So I decided to do a show<br>
              It was about comedy and foolery<br>
              Better than sitting at home and watching the traffic scenery<br>
              <br>
              Let me tell you something folks<br>
              I Started it with some jokes<br>
              The people were stingy with applause <br>
              Maybe because the jokes were cringy of course<br>
              <br>
              But once I got in my groove<br>
              Still the hands of the audience didn't move<br>
              Towards the middle of the show there was dead silence <br>
              My confidence and my self esteem was on the fence<br>
              <br>
              But the show had to finish<br>
              As my money had started to diminish<br>
              Unemployed I was<br>
              Being a moderately qualified engineer was the cause<br>
              <br>
              Stand up comedy was the only occupation left<br>
              Apart from robbery,crime and theft<br>
              Maybe people don't know engineering has this darkside<br>
              Which creates thoughts like that of suicide<br>

          <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
              Once in a jungle there was a mighty bear <br>
              So big he was all covered in black hair <br>
              Furious he looked and was so gall<br>
              In a bite,a man he could maul<br>
              <br>
              Ben's brother, a victim of the Bear's rage <br>
              None could every have thought the best was so Savage <br>
              So he went around in the village asking for help <br>
              Nothing did he hear apart from a dog's Yelp<br>
              <br>
              So he went,to take on the bear alone
              Without thinking twice he entered the danger zone
              To kill the bear he had planned a trap
              But the bear was smart,OH CRAP!! <br>
              <br>
              Ripped into pieces the boy was <br> 
              Gave up his life for a worthy cause <br>
              He tried to improve the life of the people of the village <br>
              And to make peace with his dead brothers image <br>
              <br>
              Rise ,we must all <br>
              Help the person trying to make a change <br>
              Before he crumbles and falls <br>
              And we continue living on the same page <br>
